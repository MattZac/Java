Not final outline, just conceptual. Trying to experiment with Classes, Abstract Classes, and maybe interfaces?

Vehicle (Class, abstract):
        Make (String, Enum)
        Model (String, Enum)
        Weight (Int)
        Engine (Class)
    Car(Class, extends Vehicle)
    Truck(Class, extends Vehicle)
    Motorcycle(Class, extends Vehicle)
    
Engine (Class):
    Name (String)
    Type (String)
    Horse Power (Int)

Raceway (Class)
    Vehicle 1 (Class)
    Vehicle 2 (Class)
    Race (Method)

Main (Class)
